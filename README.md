# Autism-Prediction

In this project, we will predict the presence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost etc. We will also perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and evaluate the results based on various metrics.
